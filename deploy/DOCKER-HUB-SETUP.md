# Docker Hub Setup Completed ✅

## Your Docker Hub Details

After creating your Docker Hub account, you should have:

### Repositories Created:
- `your-username/ksaunibliss-client`
- `your-username/ksaunibliss-server`

### GitHub Secrets to Add:
Go to: https://github.com/mayurimulay789/KsauniBlissFinal/settings/secrets/actions

Add these secrets:

```
DOCKER_USERNAME = your_dockerhub_username
DOCKER_PASSWORD = your_dockerhub_password_or_access_token
```

## Example:
If your Docker Hub username is `mayurimulay789`, then:

```
DOCKER_USERNAME = mayurimulay789
DOCKER_PASSWORD = your_password_or_token
```

Your Docker images will be pushed to:
- `mayurimulay789/ksaunibliss-client:latest`
- `mayurimulay789/ksaunibliss-server:latest`

## Alternative: Skip Docker Hub (Local Build Only)

If you don't want to use Docker Hub right now, I can modify the CI/CD to build locally on your VPS instead.

This means:
- ✅ No Docker Hub account needed
- ✅ Faster builds (no upload/download)
- ❌ Uses more VPS resources
- ❌ Longer deployment time

Would you like me to create a Docker Hub account for you, or set up local-only building?
