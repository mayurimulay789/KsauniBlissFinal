# Frontend Optimization Guide

## Optimized Components

This directory contains optimized versions of key components from the main application. These components have been enhanced for better performance with the following optimizations:

### General Optimizations:
- Added proper memoization using React.memo
- Extracted sub-components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Added PropTypes for better type checking and documentation
- Optimized image loading with proper dimensions and formats
- Used callback functions to avoid recreation on each render

### Specific Component Optimizations:

#### Navbar
- Split into smaller, focused sub-components
- Memoized expensive calculations and event handlers
- Optimized search functionality with debouncing
- Improved mobile navigation performance

#### ProductCard
- Optimized image loading with proper dimensions
- Added explicit width/height attributes to avoid layout shifts
- Improved hover animations performance
- Memoized to prevent re-renders when parent updates

#### LoadingSpinner
- Simplified animation logic
- Reused animation objects to avoid recreating on every render
- Added customization options for different contexts

#### NetworkStatus
- Optimized event listeners with proper cleanup
- Added SSR-safe initialization

#### VirtualizedProductGrid
- Implemented virtualization for better performance with large product lists
- Added lazy loading of products as user scrolls
- Optimized rendering with IntersectionObserver API

## How to Use

Instead of importing components directly from the `components` directory, import the optimized versions:

```jsx
// Before
import Navbar from '../components/Navbar';
import ProductCard from '../components/ProductCard';

// After
import { Navbar, ProductCard } from '../components/optimized';
```

## Performance Impact

These optimizations should result in:
- Faster initial page load times
- Reduced memory usage
- Smoother animations and interactions
- Better performance on mobile devices
- Improved Core Web Vitals scores

## Implementation Notes

Some optimized components may require additional props or have slightly different behavior. Refer to the PropTypes definitions in each component for documentation on the required props and options.
